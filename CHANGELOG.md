### Deprecated
| Before               | Use instead                             |
| :------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| `&bri=[-100/+100]`   | `&mod=[brightness multiplier]`          |
| `&a=focal-[x%]-[y%]` | `&fpx=[x offset]` and `&fpy=[y offset]` |

### Removed
The `weserv_mode proxy|file;` directive is removed in favour of the `weserv proxy|filter;` directive. This means that
all occurrences of `weserv on|off;` and `weserv_mode proxy|file;` should be removed from existing nginx configurations.

To enable the Weserv module, it is now mandatory to include the `weserv proxy|filter;` directive in the location block.
For example:
```diff
@@ -1,12 +1,10 @@
 server {
-    weserv on;
-
     location / {
-        weserv_mode proxy;
+        weserv proxy;
     }
 
     location /static {
-        weserv_mode file;
+        weserv filter;
 
         alias /var/www/imagesweserv/public;
     }
```

- Image tinting (`&tint=`).
- Arbitrary rotation angles (`&ro=`).
- Background color when rotating by arbitrary angles (`&rbg=`).
- Adaptive row filtering (`&af`, PNG only).

- Retrieve the largest/smallest page from a multi-resolution image (`&page=-1` / `&page=-2`) ([#170](https://github.com/weserv/images/issues/170)).
- Duotone filter effect (`&filt=duotone`). The two contrasting colours can be specified with `&start=` and `&stop=`.

- Support for changing the `max-age` of the `Cache-Control` HTTP-header (`&maxage=`) ([#186](https://github.com/weserv/images/issues/186)).

## [4.0.0] - started 2018-07-17

Requires libvips 8.7+ and OpenResty 1.13.6.2+.

See [this blog post](https://wsrv.nl/news/2018/07/29/introducing-api-4/) for a summary of the new features in API 4.

### Added
- Mask background (`&mbg=`).

### Changed
- Rewrote the complete code base to Lua and switched to [OpenResty](https://openresty.org/en/).
    - Switch from libvips' [PHP binding](https://github.com/libvips/php-vips) to the [LuaJIT binding](https://github.com/libvips/lua-vips).
- The `&shape` and `&strim` parameters were renamed to `&mask` and `&mtrim`.
- Support for URI's starting with `http://` and `https://`.

### Deprecated
| Before    | Use instead |
| :-------- | :---------- |
| `&shape=` | `&mask=`    |
| `&strim=` | `&mtrim=`   |

## [3.0.0] - started 2017-01-01

Requires libvips 8.7+ and PHP 7.1+.

### Note
With the magical help of [libvips](https://github.com/libvips/libvips) and the PHP binding [php-vips](https://github.com/libvips/php-vips), we "officially" support `PNG`, `JPG`, `WEBP`, `GIF` (not animated), `SVG`, `PDF` and `TIFF` as image input. "Unofficially" we're supporting all [libMagick image file types](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/formats.php#supported).

### Added
- `&output=webp` and `&output=tiff` in an effort to support more image formats as output ([#68](https://github.com/weserv/images/issues/68)).
- Device pixel ratio (`&dpr=`) ([#115](https://github.com/weserv/images/issues/115)).
- Letterboxing (`&t=letterbox`) ([#80](https://github.com/weserv/images/issues/80)).
- Rotation by any multiple of 90 (`&or=`).
- Smart crop `&a=entropy` or `&a=attention` (only works when `&t=square`).
- Focal point cropping (`&a=crop-x%-y%`, only works when `&t=square`).
- Shape cropping (`&shape=`).
- Brightness adjustment (`&bri=`).
- Contrast adjustment (`&con=`).
- Gamma adjustment (`&gam=`).
- Sharpen an image (`&sharp=`).
- Background color of an image (`&bg=`) ([#81](https://github.com/weserv/images/issues/81)).
- Blur effect (`&blur=`) ([#69](https://github.com/weserv/images/issues/69)).
- Filter effect (`&filt=`).
- The filename returned in the `Content-Disposition` header (`&filename=`) ([#122](https://github.com/weserv/images/issues/122) and [#78](https://github.com/weserv/images/issues/78)).
- Support for Cyrillic and Arabic characters ([#13](https://github.com/weserv/images/issues/13)).
- Redirect to a default image if the image URL is not found (`&errorredirect=`) ([#37](https://github.com/weserv/images/issues/37)).
- Load a given page (`&page=`, for PDF, TIFF and multi-size ICO files).
- Support for non-standard ports ([#10](https://github.com/weserv/images/issues/10)).
- A privacy policy. See [Privacy-Policy.md](Privacy-Policy.md).
- A Docker image for easier deployment. See the [Docker installation instructions](docker/README.md).

### Changed
- Dropped [Intervention Image](http://image.intervention.io/) in favor of [php-vips](https://github.com/libvips/php-vips) because resizing an image with [libvips](https://github.com/libvips/libvips) is typically 4x-5x faster than using the quickest ImageMagick.
- We're now using the [uri package](https://github.com/thephpleague/uri) in order to parse URIs correctly. This is a drop-in replacement to PHP’s `parse_url` function.

### Deprecated
| Before    | Use instead     |
| :-------- | :-------------- |
| `&a=t`    | `&a=top`        |
| `&a=b`    | `&a=bottom`     |
| `&a=l`    | `&a=left`       |
| `&a=r`    | `&a=right`      |
| `&circle` | `&shape=circle` |

## [2.0.0] - started 2015-12-27

### Note
This version was never used in production, it's only used for testing purposes, and it was a beginning to re-write the entire image proxy (which is in production since 2007).

### Added
- Add CHANGELOG.md based on [’Keep a CHANGELOG’](https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog).
- Composer ready and [PSR-2](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) compliant.
- Used the [Intervention Image](http://image.intervention.io/) library for image handling and manipulation.
- Used the [Guzzle](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle) library for sending HTTP requests.

## [1.0.0] - started 2007-09-10

### Note
The start of our image proxy. See for more details [here](https://github.com/weserv/images/wiki).
